CSS: Cascading Style Sheets

Combinators:
    Ways to specify which element needs to be affected from the style.
    Types:
        Adjecent Sibling(+):
            Applies if the second tag is directly adjecent with respect to the first tag.
            eg.
                div + p {
                    color: red;         // This applies red color on <p> tag which is directly followed by the div tag
                }

        General Sibling(~):
            Applies if the second tag occurs after the first tag.
            eg.
                div ~ p {
                    color: red;         // This applies red color on <p> tag which is followed by the div 
                }                          tag, not necessarily adjecent.
                            
        Child(>):
            Applies if the second tag is under the level(2nd level) of the first tag.
            eg.
                div > p {
                    color: red;         // Applies when p is under div, that too just under div(same level)
                }

        Descendant(<space>):
            Applies if the second tag is under the first tag. Level doesn't matter.
    
Selectors:
    Ways to select the elements which need to get styled.
    Types:
        Elements:
            HTML: <h1>
            CSS: h1 { }
        Classes:
            HTML: <h1 class="my-class">
            CSS: .my-class { }
        Universal:
            HTML: <h1><p><button>
            CSS: * { }
        IDs:
            HTML: <h1 id="temp">
            CSS: #temp { }
        Attributes:
            HTML: <button disabled>
            CSS: [disabled] { }
        
Cascading: Multiple rules can apply to the same element.

Specificity:
    Resolve conflicts arising from multiple rules.
    Priority order:
        Inline Styles
             v
        #ID selectors
             v
        .class, pseudo-class and [attribute] selectors
             v
        <Tag> and ::pseudo-element selectors

CSS is Case Insensitive.

Inheritance:
    Styles are applied to the most parent element (body) and are inherited by all the child elements.
    Inheritance have the lowest Specificity.
    To increase the specificity of inheritance, we use the 'inherit' value on a property.
    eg.
        font-family: inherit;
